# Kivy Calculator Beta (version 0.01)

This is a GUI calculator application built on the Python Kivy module.
(Beta version ðŸ’©ðŸ’©). It's a cross platform application that means it can be used in any machine that uses the latest operating systems such as Linux, Mac, Android and IOS...
Oh and obviously ðŸ’© Windows. ðŸ™„ðŸ™„
(not ment for Windows users though.)

As this application is still in Beta, this doesn't have any windows or android executable right now.
Currently this program can only be executed in Linux and Mac.
Sooner or later this will be ready to be used anywhere. 
## Color Reference

This application follows the color scheme of the Popular gtk theme Qogir.
